# Repository CI

GitHub profile Markdown. Source images are produced by github-stats; this repository does not regenerate them.

Every PR, default-branch push and manual dispatch runs read-only JSON/TOML/YAML,
merge/case conflict, private-key and secret checks through prek. The shared
`ci / required` gate rejects missing, failed, cancelled and skipped prerequisites.
Checks must leave tracked files unchanged. All action references use full release
tags from the shared automation hub; Renovate tracks action and hook versions.

Run `SKIP=no-commit-to-branch prek run --all-files` locally with prek 0.5.2.
Use `prek install` for local checks and `prek install --hook-type commit-msg` for
Conventional Commit validation. The local branch hook is skipped in CI.

Automerge remains off until strict protection and corrected shared policy are activated.

Content checks do not prove prose accuracy, external-service availability, or
application behavior. No application build or placeholder tests are introduced.
